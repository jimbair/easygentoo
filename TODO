1. Create kernelprune.py
    -run emerge --prune --pretend and
        -find what's being removed
        -what's being used/protected
    -run eselect kernel list and see what's being used
    -run uname -r and see what's being used
    -verify we're running the same version as both
     protected by portage and chosen by eselect

    -When confirmed, do:
        -emerge --prune
        -Remove the following items from kernels
         listed in the --prune --pretend:
            -System.map, initrd, and vmlinuz from /boot/
            -Source folders from /usr/src/
            -Modules from /lib/modules/
            -Entries from /menu/grub/menu.list

    -Option to save previous kernel (maybe by default?)

2. Either create a shell script or merge into gentooupdate.py that finds package updates that portage's emerge -uDaN doesn't seem to find. Current shell script that can find these:

emerge -pe world | egrep '^\[ebuild     U \]' | cut -d ']' -f 2- | cut -d '.' -f -1

Need to drop the last dash (-) and all chars after it, and emerge -u them all.
