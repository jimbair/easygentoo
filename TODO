1. Leverage eslect for kernel updates and allow manual builds as well as genkernel since I'm now old and lazy.

2. Create kernelprune.py (still valid? investigate depclean vs prune)
    -run emerge --prune --pretend and
        -find what's being removed
        -what's being used/protected
    -run eselect kernel list and see what's being used
    -run uname -r and see what's being used
    -verify we're running the same version as both
     protected by portage and chosen by eselect

    -When confirmed, do:
        -emerge --prune
        -Remove the following items from kernels
         listed in the --prune --pretend:
            -System.map, initrd, and vmlinuz from /boot/
            -Source folders from /usr/src/
            -Modules from /lib/modules/
            -Entries from /menu/grub/menu.list

    -Option to save previous kernel (maybe by default?)


3. Make etc-update-diff.sh dynamic so it can work with 0001 or even 0009 files instead of only 0000. If the same config file has 2 updates in the queue, the # rises sequentially.
